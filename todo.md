- [X] Functions should always consume their arguments (AllowIf(bool b, value) should always consume two arguments!)
- [X] Make ellipsis args work (are currently ignored)
- [X] Allow user to declare bottom arguments
- [ ] Declared function args can have arguments (declare that you take a func(int) -> bool or whatever)
- [X] Fix argument buffering- prime eats every other value?
