# Welcome! To a more fluent world.

It's good to have you here. Welcome to Fluency, a programming language that's a little different. I've enjoyed making it, and I hope you enjoy using it. The articles are on the left are arranged from top to bottom in how I think is best to start learning the language and seeing what's going on, but feel free to skip around if something else looks interesting. Follow your dreams.

This guide is still under construction, and I plan on adding more in the future!
