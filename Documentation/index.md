# Welcome to Fluency!
## Hope you like function calls, buddy.

Fluency is a functional programming language inspired by "fluent" APIs like C#'s LINQ. No variables here, only function calls that can branch off each other and merge back in.

You can find the code on [my github](https://github.com/Kansattica/Fluency).

I'm writing an in-progress tutorial [here](articles/intro.md), which includes building and running Fluency from source.

### You can try Fluency right now in your browser! <https://kansattica.github.io/FluencyOnline/>
Note that Fluency Online is still in beta. If something doesn't work, please let me know and try the download and run version.

If you would prefer to build and run Fluency on your computer, please see the tutorial [here](articles/setup.md).

A real tutorial is coming, but for now, feel free to check out the list of [builtin functions](xref:Fluency.Execution.Functions.BuiltIn) and the [examples](https://github.com/Kansattica/Fluency/tree/master/Examples), especially [prime.fl](https://github.com/Kansattica/Fluency/blob/master/Examples/prime.fl).
